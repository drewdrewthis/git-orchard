# git-orchard

A tmux-native TUI for managing git worktrees. Browse worktrees, preview live session content, and switch between them — all without leaving your terminal.

## How it works

Orchard runs as a persistent named tmux session. Each worktree you open becomes its own tmux session. The orchard session stays alive in the background, auto-refreshing every 60 seconds, and you can jump back to it at any time with `^B o`.

```
orchard session (persistent, auto-refreshing)
├── worktree list + live preview
└── ^B o from any worktree session returns here

feat/login session
├── your shell / editor / claude
└── status bar: branch  PR#42 ◌ review  │  ^B o orchard  ^B ( prev ...
```

## Features

- **Worktree list** with branch, PR status, and review state
- **Live pane preview** — see what's running in each session before switching
- **Switch sessions** with Enter — creates the session if it doesn't exist
- **Consistent tmux UI** — every session gets the same styled status bar with a cheatsheet
- **PR status** from GitHub — failing CI, unresolved threads, changes requested, approved
- **Open PRs in browser** — jump straight to GitHub
- **Delete worktrees** with confirmation
- **Batch cleanup** — remove all worktrees with merged/closed PRs
- **Auto-refresh** — list updates in the background every 60s

## Install

```bash
npm install -g git-orchard
```

## Setup

```bash
git-orchard init
```

Add the printed shell function to your `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`, then reload:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

This creates an `orchard` command that creates and attaches to the persistent orchard tmux session. Always use `orchard`, not `git-orchard` directly.

## Usage

```bash
orchard          # Open the orchard session (creates it if needed)
orchard cleanup  # Jump straight to cleanup view
orchard init     # Print shell function
orchard --json   # Output worktree data as JSON and exit
```
